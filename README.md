## Playbooks
* ###EC2

  Launch/Start/Stop/Terminate EC2 instances on AWS.

  * ####Variable file: 
    
    Update `example_ec2_vars.yml` as per your requirement

    EC2 playbook is controlled by a yaml file with variables defined for the EC2 instances. An example variable file -`example_ec2_vars.yml` - is included in this repo. You can define your own yaml file with the following information:

    ```yaml
    ---
    key_pair: <key-name>
    instance_type: <instance-type>
    region: <region>
    security_group_id: <security-group-id>
    num_instances: <num-of-instances>
    subnet_id: <subent-id>
    tag_key_vals:
      Name: <cluster-name>
      <custom-tag-key1>: <custom-tag-val1>
      <custom-tag-key2>: <custom-tag-val2>
    ```

    The `Name` tag in the `tag_key_vals` is mandatory to create an identifier for the instances. More tags can be added if needed but are optional.

  * ####Launch EC2 instances:
    
    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./ec2.yml --extra-vars "vars_file=./example_ec2_vars.yml" --tags launch
    ```
  * ####Stop EC2 instances:
  
    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./ec2.yml --extra-vars "vars_file=./example_ec2_vars.yml" --tags stop 
    ```
  * ####Start EC2 instances:
  
    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./ec2.yml --extra-vars "vars_file=./example_ec2_vars.yml" --tags start 
    ```
  * ####Terminate EC2 instances:
  
    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./ec2.yml --extra-vars "vars_file=./example_ec2_vars.yml" --tags terminate
    ```

* ###Zookeeper
  For Zookeeper playbook, a `zookeeper_tag` needs to be specified to identify the nodes in the cluster. This `zookeeper_tag` can be any tag specified in `tag_key_vals` in the variable file for [EC2]( while launching EC2 instances.

  The `zookeeper_tag` is specifed as `<key>_<value>` for one of the `tag_key_vals` to be used. For example, if the `<cluster-name>` in the [EC2 variable file](example_ec2_vars.yml) mentioned above was `test-cluster`, the `zookeeper_tag` would be specified as `zookeeper_tag=Name_test-cluster`. It doesn't have to be the `Name` tag but could be any key value pair in `tag_key_vals` specified as `zookeeper_tag=<key>_<value>`.

  * ####Install Zookeeper:

    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./zookeeper.yml --extra-vars "zookeeper_tag=<cluster_tag>" --tags install
    ```
  * ####Start Zookeeper:

    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./zookeeper.yml --extra-vars "zookeeper_tag=<cluster_tag>" --tags start
    ```
  * ####Get info about Zookeeper on the specified cluster:

    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./zookeeper.yml --extra-vars "zookeeper_tag=<cluster_tag>" --tags info
    ```
  * ####Stop Zookeeper:

    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./zookeeper.yml --extra-vars "zookeeper_tag=<cluster_tag>" --tags stop 
    ```
  * ####Uninstall Zookeeper:

    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./zookeeper.yml --extra-vars "zookeeper_tag=<cluster_tag>" --tags uninstall
    ```

* ###Kafka
  Kafka has a dependency on Zookeeper for cluster membership, topic configuration, data partition, etc. For Kafka playbook, a `zookeeper_tag` and a `kafka_tag` needs to be specified to identify the nodes in the zookeeper and kafka cluster respectively. The `kafka_tag` and `zookeeper_tag` can be any tag specified in `tag_key_vals` in the variable file for [EC2](while launching EC2 instances).

  The `kafka_tag` and `zookeeper_tag` are specifed as `<key>_<value>` for one of the `tag_key_vals` to be used. For example, if the `<cluster-name>` in the [EC2 variable file](#variable-file) mentioned above was `test-cluster` and we had same cluster for Zookeeper and Kafka, the `kafka_tag` and `zookeeper_tag` would be specified as `zookeeper_tag=Name_test-cluster` and `kafka_tag=Name_test-cluster` respectively. Both Zookeeper and Kafka don't have to be on the same cluster and it doesn't have to be the `Name` tag but it could be any key value pair in `tag_key_vals` specified as `zookeeper_tag=<key>_<value>` and `kafka_tag=<key>_<value>`.

  ####Kafka's dependency on Zookeeper

  Kafka's dependency on Zookeeper is taken care of by the Kafka playbook. If you are trying to ssetup Kafka on the cluster specified by `kafka_tag`, the playbook will check that Zookeeper is installed on the cluster `zookeeper_tag` and if it is not setup, the playbook will first setup Zookeeper and then Kafka. By default, any operation on Kafka cluster, like `start`, `install`, etc., will first be executed on the Zookeeper cluster. However, we would want some of the operations to be executed on the Kafka cluster, like `stop`, `uninstall`, etc., not be executed on the Zookeeper cluster. This can be achieved by specifying a flag `--skip-tags zookeeper` while running the Kafka playbook. Examples for this behavior are shown below in the `stop` and `uninstall` operations.
  

  * ####Install Kafka:

    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./kafka.yml --extra-vars "zookeeper_tag=<cluster_tag> kafka_tag=<cluster_tag>" --tags install
    ```
  * ####Start Kafka:

    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./kafka.yml --extra-vars "zookeeper_tag=<cluster_tag> kafka_tag=<cluster_tag>" --tags start
    ```
  * ####Get info about Kafka on the specified cluster:

    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./kafka.yml --extra-vars "zookeeper_tag=<cluster_tag> kafka_tag=<cluster_tag>" --tags info
    ```
  * ####Stop Kafka:

    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./kafka.yml --extra-vars "zookeeper_tag=<cluster_tag> kafka_tag=<cluster_tag>" --tags stop --skip-tags zookeeper
    ```
  * ####Uninstall Kafka:

    ```bash
    ~$ ansible-playbook ./kafka.yml --extra-vars "zookeeper_tag=<cluster_tag> kafka_tag=<cluster_tag>" --tags uninstall --skip-tags zookeeper

    ```
